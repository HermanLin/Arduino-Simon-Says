### Wiring for Simon Says game

### How to play:
The right-most pushbutton is the start button, pressing this will play a start tune and then begin the game.
A sequence of lights will begin to flash, starting with one LED. 
When all the LEDs blink at the same time, this signals that it is either the player's or Simon's turn.
After a sequence is flashed, the player must repeat the sequence back to Simon.

### Improvements that could be made
- Some of the timings can be altered to fit the player
